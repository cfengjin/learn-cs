# 蜀道難 The Path to Shu is Difficult

### 噫吁嚱危乎高哉蜀道之難難於上青天

Oh, how dangerous and tall it is! The path to Shu's difficulty is more difficult than ascending to the blue sky.

### 蠶叢及魚鳧開國何茫然

Tsan Tsong and Yü Fu (Founders of Shu), how can you be so ignorant in founding your state!

### 爾來四萬八千歲不與秦塞通人煙

You've been here 48,000 years and haven't communicated with the fortresses of Qin.

### 西當太白有鳥道可以橫絕峨眉巔

To the west of Mount Taibai, there is a path where only birds can cut across to the peaks of Mount Emei.

### 地崩山摧壯士死然後天梯石棧相鉤連

The earth bursted, mountains were destroyed, and warriors perished, then sky-high ladders and cliffside plank paths chained together.

### 上有六龍回日之高標下有衝波逆折之回川

Above is the peak where six dragons pull the Sun's chariot, below lies the rapids where the waves crash and break.

### 黃鶴之飛尚不得過猿猱欲度愁攀援

The yellow crane's flight still can't cross, the apes wanting to go over worry about the climb.

### 青泥何盤盤百步九折縈巖巒

### 捫參歷井仰脅息以手撫膺坐長歎

### 問君西遊何時還畏途巉巖不可攀

### 但見悲鳥號古木雄飛雌從繞林間

### 又聞子規啼夜月愁空山

### 蜀道之難難於上青天使人聽此凋朱顏

### 連峯去天不盈尺枯松倒掛倚絕壁

### 飛湍瀑流爭喧豗砯崖轉石萬壑雷

### 其險也如此嗟爾遠道之人胡爲乎來哉

### 劍閣崢嶸而崔嵬一夫當關萬夫莫開

### 所守或匪親化爲狼與豺

### 朝避猛虎夕避長蛇磨牙吮血殺人如麻

### 錦城雖云樂不如早還家

### 蜀道之難難於上青天側身西望長咨嗟
