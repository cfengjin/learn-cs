# 蜀道難 (唐代李白詩作)

The Path to Shu is Difficult by Tang Dynasty poet Li Bai

<br />

### 噫吁嚱危乎高哉蜀道之難難於上青天

Oh, how dangerous and tall it is! The path to Shu's difficulty is harder than reaching the blue sky!

### 蠶叢及魚鳧開國何茫然

Tsan Tsong and Yü Fu (founders of Shu), how was the state founded with such ignorance!

### 爾來四萬八千歲不與秦塞通人煙

Thou'st been here 48,000 years and haven't communicated with the fortresses of Qin.

### 西當太白有鳥道可以橫絕峨眉巔

To the west of Mount Taibai, there is a path where only birds can cut across to the peaks of Mount Emei.

### 地崩山摧壯士死然後天梯石棧相鉤連

The earth bursted, mountains were destroyed, and warriors perished, then sky-high steps and cliffside plank paths hooked together.

### 上有六龍回日之高標下有衝波逆折之回川

Above is the peak where six dragons pull the Sun's chariot; below lies the rapids where the waves crash and break.

### 黃鶴之飛尚不得過猿猱欲度愁攀援

The yellow crane's flight still can't cross; the apes wanting to go over worry about the climb.

### 青泥何盤盤百步九折縈巖巒

Mount Qingni twists and turns; every hundred steps breaks direction nine times, coiling the mountain peak.

### 捫參歷井仰脅息以手撫膺坐長歎

Touching Zeta Ori (star associated with Shu) and experiencing Mu Gem (star associated with Qin), I look up with my breath held. With my hand on my chest, I let out an empty sigh.

### 問君西遊何時還畏途巉巖不可攀

When will you return from your westward journey? The dangerous paths and precipitous walls, I wouldn't dare climb.

### 但見悲鳥號古木雄飛雌從繞林間

You only hear sorrow birds wail on the old trees. The male birds fly while females follow them through the woods.

### 又聞子規啼夜月愁空山

Again, you hear the cuckoo cry under the moonlit night, overcome with sorrow from the empty mountains.

### 蜀道之難難於上青天使人聽此凋朱顏

The path to Shu's difficulty is harder than reaching the blue sky! Letting people hear about it makes their faces pale.

### 連峯去天不盈尺枯松倒掛倚絕壁

The row of peak's gap from the sky doesn't measure a full chi (~1/3 of a meter). Withered pines hang upside down against the steep rock face.

### 飛湍瀑流爭喧豗砯崖轉石萬壑雷

Rapids and waterfalls compete to be the noisiest, striking the cliffs and sending rocks tumbling—countless valleys thunder.

### 其險也如此嗟爾遠道之人胡爲乎來哉

With this danger as such—you, far-travelling person—why have you come here!

### 劍閣崢嶸而崔嵬一夫當關萬夫莫開

The Sword Gate Pass is towering and lofty; one man stands guard, thousands can't pass through.

### 所守或匪親化爲狼與豺

If this guard doesn't know you, then he might as well be a wolf and jackal.

### 朝避猛虎夕避長蛇磨牙吮血殺人如麻

At morning, avoid the fierce tigers; at night, avoid the long snakes. Grinding teeth and sucking blood, dead people are everywhere.

### 錦城雖云樂不如早還家

Chengdu may be fun, but it's better to come home early.

### 蜀道之難難於上青天側身西望長咨嗟

The path to Shu's difficulty is harder than reaching the blue sky! I look over to the west and draw a long sigh...
