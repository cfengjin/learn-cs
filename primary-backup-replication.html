      <h1>Primary-Backup Replication</h1>
      <p>
        Replicated state machines serve clients and stay in sync by checking in with every other replica.
        If any machine goes down, then the system can't progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Primary-backup replication introduces hierarchy and specialization to handle this issue.
        Instead of machines relying on each other, a primary machine takes on the responsibility of serving clients and acts as a source of truth.
        The primary forwards state changes and communicates with backup machines in case the primary goes down.
        When any backup goes down, the primary must successfully copy its state to any new backup in order for the state to persist.
        This system should be internally consistent for there to be consistency externally.
      </p>
      <p>
        To keep track of which machine is the primary and which machines are backups, an external service needs to be introduced: the view service.
        A view depicts which machines are which, and in order to distinguish between the current view and previous ones, a view also has a view number.
        The view service holds the current view and updates it when needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clients contact the view service to know which machine to communicate with.
