      <h1>Primary-Backup Replication</h1>
      <p>
        Replicated state machines serve clients and stay in sync by checking in with every other replica.
        If any machine goes down, then the system can't progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Primary-backup replication introduces hierarchy and specialization to handle this issue.
        Instead of each machine relying on every other machine, a primary machine takes on the responsibility of serving clients.
        If the primary goes down, then a readied backup machine will take over.
        To keep track of who's the primary and who's the backup, an external service needs to be introduced: the view service.
      </p>
      <p>
        The view service holds the current view and updates it whenever it detects a change.
        A view holds a view number and information about who's the primary and who's the backup.
        The view number is used to distinguish between the current view and previous views.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clients contact the view service to know which machine to communicate with.
